# USB-HID-Treadmill-Hack
Control speed + incline using Windows PC + 4 channel USB HID Relay board

![App icon](icon.jpg?raw=true "Icon")

Requirements

Hardware:
* Treadmill with accessible buttons for speed +/- incline +/-
* QYF-UR04 Minimum 4 Channel HID Drive-free USB Delay Relay Interface Board Module Optocoupler (with CH551G USB chip)
  e.g. https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/283294148232
* Windows PC near treadmill, 1 USB port

![Relay board](relay.jpg?raw=true "board")

Software:
* Hidapitester https://github.com/todbot/hidapitester/releases/tag/0.1

![Screenshot](setup.jpg?raw=true "setup")

Fields:
* Duration [minutes] (i.e. length of the movie you will watch during workout)
* Speed - desired speed
* Warm-up / Wind-down time [minutes] - how quickly reach desired speed
* Sprint - maximum speed during sprint phases
* Sprint duration [minutes] - how long the sprint period is
* Hill - incline increase during "hill" phases
* Reps - how many times the (hill+sprint) section repeated (with decreasing hills)
* Start button - press again to Stop (prompt)
* Progress - you can edit this and restart a stopped session

Settings are saved between sessions

* Progress [minutes] - how far into the duration
* Next [minutes] - until the next change (speed or incline)
* Speed - current speed (adjust treadmill if they don't match)
* Incline - current incline (adjust treadmill if they don't match)
* [X] - close app (prompt if session active)
* [ ] - keep window on top

**Workout**

I plan to add more, currently there is one implemented:

![Chart](chart.png?raw=true "chart")

* in *warmup* minutes increase from 3.0 to desired *speed*
* 
* slowly increase incline from 0 to *hill*
* slowly decrease include from *hill* to 0
* Sprint for *sprint duration* at *sprint speed*
* slowly increase incline from 0 to half *hill*
* slowly decrease incline from half *hill* to 0
* Sprint for *sprint duration* at *sprint speed*
* 
* ...repeat *reps* times (with decreasing hills)
* 
* in *winddown* minutes decrease desired *speed* to 3.0
* end of workout - end of movie

Heart rate for a 126 minute workout (movie Shazam)

![Heartrate](heart2.jpg?raw=true "heartrate")

The workout logic is in the function workout1:

* dur - duration in seconds
* p - progress
* s - speed
* r - incline
* speed - desired speed
* hl - hill 
* sp - sprint
* warm - warmup/winddown duration between 0.1 steps (in seconds)

**Calls** 

toggle(switch, state)
* switch: SPEED_UP = 1, SPEED_DOWN = 2, INCL_UP = 3, INCL_DOWN = 4, ALL = 9
* state: ON=1, OFF=0

press(switch)
* it will wait 0.5 sec between ON and OFF

wait(delay)
* delay in seconds
* returns true if stop was pressed

**Set path to HIDAPITester and your VIDPID**

After opening the app at least once, find the configuration file under 
C:\Users\???\AppData\Local\walk\walk_???\1.0.0.0\user.config

Add two settings manually (otherwise some incorrect defaults will be used):

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
     <configuration>
         <configSections>
             <sectionGroup name="userSettings" type="System.Configuration.UserSettingsGroup, System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager, Version=4.0.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51" >
                <section name="walk.Properties.Settings" type="System.Configuration.ClientSettingsSection, System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager, Version=4.0.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51" allowExeDefinition="MachineToLocalUser" requirePermission="false" />
             </sectionGroup>
         </configSections>
         <userSettings>
             <walk.Properties.Settings>
              <setting name="Duration" serializeAs="String"><value>100</value></setting>
              <setting name="Sprint" serializeAs="String"><value>7.5</value></setting>
              <setting name="Warmup" serializeAs="String"><value>8</value></setting>
              <setting name="Speed" serializeAs="String"><value>6.2</value></setting>
              
              <!-- Add these two lines -->
              <setting name="HIDAPIPath" serializeAs="String"><value>c:\HIDAPITester\hidapitester.exe</value></setting>
              <setting name="Vidpid" serializeAs="String"><value>0519</value></setting>
              
             </walk.Properties.Settings>
         </userSettings>
     </configuration>

**How to find vidpid**

    Use command:

    hidapitester --list

    Look for the id in the beginning of the line which has "HIDRelay":

    e.g.:
    0519/2018: Ucreatefun.com - HIDRelay
    â†“
    here the vidpid is 0519

    Then you can open, write, close in one command.

    hidapitester --vidpid 0519 --open --send-output 0,241 --close >nul

    output 0,241: shorts channel 1
    output 0,1: opens channel 1
    output 0,242: shorts channel 2
    etc

    finally:
    output 0,249:shorts all channels
    output 0,9: opens all channels

**Plans**
* Add more workout programs with selector
* Make window moveable, resizable

...or not. Currently this is what I need, I provide it as a basis for anyone wanting to create something similar.
